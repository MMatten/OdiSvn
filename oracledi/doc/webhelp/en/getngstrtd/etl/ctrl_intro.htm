<h1>Introduction to Data Integration</h1>

<p>With multiple applications in your IT infrastructure reading and writing 
 to and from different data stores in varying formats, it is imperative 
 to implement a process that will let you integrate the data so that they 
 can be easily used by anyone in your company. There are numerous Data 
 Integration methods to accomplish this – ETL, Data Replication/Synchronization, 
 etc. In all of these cases, the first step in successfully integrating 
 your Information System’s data with your organization’s applications is 
 ensuring the integrity of that data.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Data Integrity Control</h2>

<p>Data integrity control is essential in ensuring the overall consistency 
 of the data in your information system's applications.</p>

<p>Application data is not always valid for the constraints and declarative 
 rules imposed by the information system. You may, for instance, find orders 
 with no customer, or order lines with no product, etc.</p>

<p>Oracle Data Integrator provides a working environment to detect these 
 constraint violation and store them for recycling or reporting purposes.</p>

<p>There are two different types of controls: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Static 
 Control</B></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Flow Control</B></span>. 
 We will examine the differences between the two.</p>

<h3>Static Control</h3>

<p>Static Control implies the existence of rules that are used to verify 
 the integrity of your application data. Some of these rules (referred 
 to as constraints) may already be implemented in your data servers (using 
 primary keys, reference constraints, etc.)</p>

<p>With Oracle Data Integrator, you can refine the validation of your data 
 by defining additional constraints, without declaring them directly in 
 your servers. This procedure is called <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Static 
 Control</B></span> since it allows you to perform checks directly on existing 
 - or static - data.</p>

<h3>Flow Control</h3>

<p>The information systems targeted by transformation and integration processes 
 often implement their own declarative rules. &nbsp;The 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Flow Control</B></span> function is used 
 to verify an application's incoming data according to these constraints 
 before loading the data into these targets. &nbsp;The 
 flow control procedure is detailed in the &quot;Interfaces&quot; chapter.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>The main advantages of performing data integrity checks are as follow:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Increased productivity by using the target database 
 for its entire life cycle. Business rule violations in the data slow down 
 application programming throughout the target database’s life-cycle. Cleaning 
 the transferred data can therefore reduce application programming time.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Validation of the target database’s model. The 
 rule violations detected do not always imply insufficient source data 
 integrity. They may reveal a degree of incompleteness in the target model. 
 Migrating the data before an application is rewritten makes it possible 
 to validate a new data model while providing a test database in line with 
 reality.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Improved quality of service for the End-users 
 will benefit from using data that has been pre-treated to filter out business 
 rule violations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ensuring data integrity is not always a simple task. &nbsp;Indeed, 
 it requires that any data violating declarative rules must be isolated 
 and recycled. This implies the development of complex programming, in 
 particular when the target database incorporates a mechanism for verifying 
 integrity constraints. &nbsp;In 
 terms of operational constraints, it is most efficient to implement a 
 method for correcting erroneous data (on the source, target or recycled 
 flows) and then to reuse this method throughout the enterprise.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following example &nbsp;will 
 guide you through the data integrity audit process (Static Control).</p>

<p>The &quot;Orders Application - HSQL&quot; application contains data 
 which do not satisfy business rule constraints on a number of different 
 levels. &nbsp;The 
 objective is to determine which data in this application does not satisfy 
 the constraints imposed by the information system.</p>
