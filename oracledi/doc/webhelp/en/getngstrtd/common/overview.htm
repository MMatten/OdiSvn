<h1>Product Overview</h1>

<h2><a name=WHAT_IS></a>What is Oracle Data Integrator?</h2>

<p>A widely used data integration software product, Oracle Data Integrator 
 provides a new declarative design approach to defining data transformation 
 and integration processes, resulting in faster and simpler development 
 and maintenance. Based on a unique “E-LT” architecture, Oracle Data Integrator 
 not only guarantees the highest level of performance possible for the 
 execution of data transformation and validation processes but is also 
 the most cost-effective solution available today.</p>

<p>Oracle Data Integrator provides a unified infrastructure to streamline 
 data and application integration projects.</p>

<h3>Business Problem</h3>

<p>In today's increasingly fast-paced business environment, organizations 
 need to use more specialized software applications; they also need to 
 ensure the coexistence of these applications on heterogeneous hardware 
 platforms and systems and guarantee the ability to share data between 
 applications and systems. &nbsp;Projects 
 that implement these integration requirements need to be delivered on-spec, 
 on-time and on-budget.</p>

<h3>A Unique Solution</h3>

<p>Oracle Data Integrator employs a powerful declarative design approach 
 to ETL, which separates the declarative rules from the implementation 
 details. Oracle Data Integrator is also based on a unique “E-LT” architecture 
 which eliminates the need for a standalone ETL server and proprietary 
 engine, and instead leverages the inherent power of your RDBMS engines. 
 This combination provides the greatest productivity for both development 
 and maintenance, and the highest performance for the execution of data 
 transformation and validation processes.</p>

<p>Here are the key reasons why more than 500 companies have chosen Oracle 
 Data Integrator for their ETL needs:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Faster and simpler 
 development and maintenance</B></span>: The declarative rules driven approach 
 to ETL greatly reduces the learning curve of the product and increases 
 developer productivity while facilitating ongoing maintenance. This approach 
 separates the definition of the processes from their actual implementation, 
 and separates the declarative rules (the “what”) from the data flows (the 
 “how”). </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Data quality 
 firewall</B></span>: Oracle Data Integrator ensures that faulty data is automatically 
 detected and recycled before insertion in the target application. This 
 is performed without the need for programming, following the data integrity 
 rules and constraints defined both on the target application and in Oracle 
 Data Integrator. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Better execution 
 performance</B></span>: traditional ETL software is based on proprietary engines 
 that perform data transformations row by row, thus limiting performance. 
 By implementing an E-LT architecture, based on your existing RDBMS engines 
 and SQL, you are capable of executing data transformations on the target 
 server at a set-based level, giving you much higher performance. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Simpler and more 
 efficient architecture</B></span>: the E-LT architecture removes the need 
 for an ETL hub server sitting between the sources and the target server. 
 It utilizes the target server and its RDBMS to perform complex transformations, 
 most of which happen in batch mode when the server is not busy processing 
 end-user queries. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Platform Independence</B></span>: 
 Oracle Data Integrator supports all platforms, hardware and OSs with the 
 same software. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Data Connectivity</B></span>: 
 Oracle Data Integrator supports all RDBMSs including all leading Data 
 Warehousing platforms such as Teradata, IBM DB2, Netezza, Oracle, Sybase 
 IQ and numerous other technologies such as flat files, ERPs, LDAP, XML. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Cost-savings</B></span>: 
 the elimination of the ETL hub server and ETL engine reduces both the 
 initial hardware and software acquisition and maintenance costs. The reduced 
 learning curve and increased developer productivity significantly reduce 
 the overall labor costs of the project, as well as the cost of ongoing 
 enhancements. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=ARCHITECTURE></a>Technical Architecture</h2>

<p>Oracle Data Integrator is built around a modular repository architecture 
 and accessed in client/server or thin client mode by components that are 
 developed entirely in Java: the graphical interface modules and execution 
 agents. </p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Repository</B></span> is a comprehensive, 
 open and shared metadata repository. It stores the metadata for the accessed 
 applications involved in the transformation and integration processing, 
 the developed project versions and all of the information required for 
 their use (planning, scheduling and execution reports).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Topology Manager</B></span> is the graphical 
 interface module used to manage the data describing the information system's 
 physical and logical architecture. The site, machine, and data server 
 descriptions will enable Oracle Data Integrator to execute the same interfaces 
 in different environments.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Designer</B></span> is a tool used to design 
 data integrity checks and to build transformations. In particular, it 
 incorporates functions for:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Automatic reverse-engineering of existing applications 
 or databases</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Graphical development and maintenance of transformation 
 and integration interfaces</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Visualization of data flows in the interfaces</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Automatic documentation generation</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Customization of the generated code</p></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Security Manager</B></span> is the tool 
 for managing users and permissions in Oracle Data Integrator.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Operator</B></span> is the production management 
 and monitoring module. It is designed for IT production operators.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Agent</B></span> is used to execute 
 the inter-application interfaces developed with Designer. It integrates 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Scheduler</B></span> to execute the interfaces 
 according to a predefined schedule.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Metadata Navigator</B></span> is a thin 
 client, browser based interface to access the Oracle Data Integrator Repository, 
 browse, search and analyze all its contents, and perform advanced data 
 lineage tracing, cross referencing, impact analysis, etc. &nbsp;You 
 may even use this tool to manage all of your production processes.</p>
